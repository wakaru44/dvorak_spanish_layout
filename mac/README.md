# MacOS X - Dvorak Spanish layout

Done with [Ukelele](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14495/ukelele).

It has some quirks, like the AltGr exposes the same symbols as qwerty, and that the B and N collide a bit for whatever reason.

To install, just copy to the custom layouts folder:

        cp *layout /Library/Keyboard Layouts

or use the makefile provided in the root of this repo
